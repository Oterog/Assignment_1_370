# Assignment_1_370

Collaborators: Gabriel Otero, 

Due: 09/20/24

Objective: <br/>
&emsp; The objective of this assignment is to show a top-level UML use case diagram showing what you believe to be the major functionalities and actors, for the above software application, from the given diagrams and short description. (Use Umlet to make your use case diagram, as per our class meetings.)

Side Notes: <br/> 
&emsp; (I.) This project requires you to provide only a top level use case diagram. <br/>
&emsp; (II.) You should not give ALL details on such a top level diagram. <br/>
&emsp; (III.) Only give the main functionalities and main actors. <br/>

Project: <br/>
&emsp; For this assignment 1, pretend that the only things you know are the following paragraph. <br/>

&emsp; The breathing circuit/ventilator [figures 5 and 3] is controlled by software to deliver fresh mixed gases to the patient, and to remove waste gases. The software will be loaded and run on the MCU (micro-controller unit) you see on the PCB of figure 4. As you see from the diagrams [figures 5 and 4], there are many sensors and valves throughout the equipment, that the software reads and attempts to control continuously. There is also a bellows assembly whose function is to force inhalation, and then allow exhalation. The software must allow the configuration (setting) of important operation and alarm limits, such as oxygen concentration, CO2 concentration, volume flow, etc. The main function of the machine is, of course, the delivery and removal of gas to the patient. This includes not only the delivery process itself, but also the indirect measures of patient status, and the notification of unexpected and potentially dangerous conditions. The ventilator is operated through a small terminal with a screen and dial/ key pad [figure 1]. Show a top-level UML use case diagram showing what you believe to be the major functionalities and actors, for the above software application, from the given diagrams and short description.
